# USB C kvm
A USB C kvm used to switch one output connection between two input connections.

This allows one to connect a peripheral to the output and a computer to each
input, and then switch which computer it should be connected to with the press
of a button.

## Goals
These are the design goals I'm aiming for:

* Full speed USB C including PD.
* Cheap and robust implementation
* SMD, but solderable by hand.
